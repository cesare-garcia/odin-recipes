# odin-recipes

In this project, I will practice my HTML skills by building a basic recipe website. It will consist of a main index page and will have links to several recipes.

The index page will have a heading in the body reading "Odin Recipes"

Each recipe page will include an image of the recipe, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of steps to create the recipe.

Add three recipes total to your page.

I will also practice atomic committing and writing good commit messages.
